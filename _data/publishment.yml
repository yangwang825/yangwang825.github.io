  description: An important paradigm of speech and sound processing consists of efficient fine-tuning on adaptation to downstream tasks or domains. The primary challenge with fully fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained model is overfitting, and the model may converge significantly slow. Herein, we propose Contrastive-based Fine-tuning (ConFit) for audio classification, which works by capturing robust representations and improve the discriminative power of the off-the-shelf models.

  url: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rCb9KI1Y0w
  code: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rCb9KI1Y0w
  description: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the generation and evaluation of analytical reports derived from Earnings Calls (ECs). Addressing a current gap in research, we explore the generation of analytical reports with LLMs in a multi-agent framework, designing specialized agents that introduce diverse viewpoints and desirable topics of analysis into the report generation process. Through multiple analyses, we examine the alignment between generated and human-written reports and the impact of both individual and collective agents.
