  url: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EmW7Fs5BOd
  code: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EmW7Fs5BOd
  description: This paper introduces a novel pooling strategy called dominant eigenvector-informed statistics pooling (Deist) that enhances the robustness of natural language processing models against adversarial attacks by leveraging higher-order information without the need for adversarial examples in training.
